# Solved-variant candidates for Formal Conjectures

`FormalConjecturesAdapter` states the three propositions that
`google-deepmind/formal-conjectures` already carries as `sorry`, so an external
`formal_proof` link resolves to their exact text.  This file is the other
direction: statements upstream does not carry at all, offered as new
`erdos_NNN.variants.*` declarations.

Upstream is built out of those.  Measured at `9943b0a0` it holds 1,012
`erdos_NNN.variants.*` declarations across 343 problem files, and `CONTRIBUTING`
welcomes solved variants; `257.variants.tsum_top` and
`1049.variants.geq_2_integer` — the two the sibling adapter discharges — are
that shape.  For six of the eight problems this repository works on, upstream's
only declaration is the open question itself, so there is no hole to fill and a
variant is the whole available route.  `docs/formal_conjectures_crosswalk.json`
records those six as `not_a_candidate`, which is correct about discharging an
existing `sorry` and says nothing about adding one.

## What is here, and what is not

A statement earns a place here when it is about the **object the problem asks
about** rather than about a route this corpus happened to walk.  The exact rank
of the dyadic totient kernel is about `∑ φ(n)/2ⁿ`; a ten-hypothesis obstruction
on a normalised orbit is about an argument that failed here, and a reader
without this repository could not use it.  On that filter the #243 negative
orbits, the numeric `2 × 2` minor for #269, the base-`3/2` corridor no-go, and
the generic cleared-tail recurrence stay out, as does the `#249`
infinite-dimensionality corollary, which the claim registry already disclaims as
implied by Coons.

Each theorem below restates one Mathlib-only proposition from
`ExternalVerification.Statements` under the name it would take upstream, and
proves it by projection from `ExternalVerification.portfolioClaims`.  No new
mathematics: the content is the registered corpus declaration, and the
`Statements` vocabulary is already Mathlib-only, so contributing one upstream is
a move of its supporting definitions into `FormalConjecturesForMathlib` rather
than a port.

**Novelty is a separate question from contribution.** Upstream does not require
a variant to be new, only that its source and status are stated correctly.  The
prior-art position of the exact `2 ^ e + 1` rank and the odd-core basis against
Martin, and of the Mersenne measure results against the Kovač–Tao line, is
unresolved here and gates the wording of any upstream docstring — not whether
the theorem may be offered.

None of these declarations resolves the other seven target problems or
adjudicates correspondence with the historical curve-length formulation of
Erdős #1041.

Upstream's `68.lean` carries the open question and one variant.  This is an

in the factorial-digit recurrence fails to be one, cofinally often.  It reduces
an analytic irrationality question to a statement about integers. -/

open question.  It says nothing about the object.  These are exact structural
facts about the dyadic totient kernel that question is asking about. -/

An exact transfer between the prime dyadic series and the consecutive-prime-gap

elementary polynomial prime bound rather than by assumption. -/

An exact identity for the object in the three-prime case: the smooth-prefix lcm

Quantitative root retention under a constant perturbation.  This is the piece

/-! ## Erdős 249, over the vocabulary upstream would own

The two theorems above are stated over `ExternalVerification.Statements`, this
repository's Mathlib-only statement vocabulary.  Formal Conjectures cannot
import that module.  A statement contributed upstream has to be built out of
constants upstream owns, which for these two means a support file of its own --
`totientKernelSeq` and the five index and family objects around it.

Copying definitions across a repository boundary is where a `formal_proof` link
stops being exact.  Two textually identical definitions in two repositories are
two different constants, and a theorem about one is not, on its face, a theorem
about the other.  Prose asserting they agree is not a proof, and not needing to
take prose for it is the whole point of the link.

What follows closes that gap the only way that is checkable.  It declares the
same six objects a second time, in the namespace and with the bodies the
upstream support file uses, and restates the two propositions over *those*
constants.  The proofs are the two theorems above, accepted with no bridging
step: the vocabularies are definitionally equal, so a proof of one proposition
is a proof of the other, and the type checker is what says so.

A reviewer can diff the block below against the upstream support file character
by character, and read the two restatements as the ones the upstream
declarations carry.

Mutating either half breaks it, which is what makes the arrangement worth
anything.  Changing the rank to `2 ^ e + 2`, or the channel to
`2 ^ j * n + r + 1`, is a type mismatch rather than a warning. -/

/-! ## Erdős 257, over the vocabulary upstream would own

The finite-period theorem above is stated over
`ExternalVerification.finiteErdosSum`.  Formal Conjectures cannot import that
module.  The support this statement needs is one definition, and it belongs in
the problem file rather than in `FormalConjecturesForMathlib`: a finite sum over
a `Finset`, nothing reusable across problems.

Copying that definition across a repository boundary is where a `formal_proof`
link stops being exact.  Two textually identical definitions in two repositories
are two different constants.  What follows declares the same object a second
time, in the namespace an upstream `257.lean` would use, and restates the
proposition over *that* constant.  The proof is the theorem above, accepted with
no bridging step.

The coprimality hypothesis is retained.  Discharging it is a reduced-denominator
argument already proved in this corpus, but it is not a one-line Mathlib fact,
and the Formal Conjectures statement should not grow a rational-arithmetic
development just to hide a hypothesis the reader can see.

Mutating the conclusion from `F.lcm id` to `F.lcm id + 1` is a type mismatch. -/

/-! ## Erdős 251, over the vocabulary upstream already owns

The transfer theorem at the top of this file pairs the *displayed* prime series
with the *normalized* gap series, so its two sides carry different denominators
and it exposes a `Summable` premise that the corpus has since proved
unconditionally.  Neither belongs in a statement offered upstream.

Upstream already owns the gap object: `FormalConjecturesForMathlib/
NumberTheory/PrimeGap.lean` defines `primeGap n = (n + 1).nth Nat.Prime -
n.nth Nat.Prime`, and `FormalConjecturesUtil` re-exports it.  So unlike the 249
and 257 blocks above, this one contributes *no* support vocabulary: the
definition below is upstream's, reproduced here only so the restatement
elaborates against a constant with upstream's body.

`erdos_251` sums `Nat.nth Nat.Prime n / 2 ^ n` from `n = 0`, so its first term
is `p₀ / 2⁰ = 2`; the classical one-based series is half of it.  Summation by
parts against that zero-based convention gives the constant `4`, not `2`.
Mutating `4` to `5`, or `primeGap n` to `primeGap (n + 1)`, is a type mismatch.

/-! ## Erdős 68, over the vocabulary upstream would own

The two `erdos_68_variants_*` theorems above are the same theorem in different
clothes.  The corpus bridge gives, for every `m ≥ 3`,

  `factorialGapStepCarry m = 1  ↔  (m : ℤ) ∣ strictFacTopRat (factorialGapPrefix m) m`

and both variants quantify cofinally, so the finitely many indices below `3`
cannot separate them.  Only one belongs upstream.

The divisibility form is the one to offer.  Its statement is purely integral —
an exact rational prefix, its strict factorial-grid successor, and a
divisibility test — so a reader can evaluate it without meeting the carry's
real-valued predecessor gap, and the support surface is two definitions rather
than five.  The carry form stays here as the internal exposition interface.

Upstream's `68.lean` opens `namespace Erdos68`, which is also where this
corpus keeps `factorialGapSeries`, so the two definitions below land in the
namespace an upstream support file would own.

`erdos_68` sums `1 / ((n + 2)! - 1)` from `n = 0`; this corpus writes the same
series as the universal tail after cutoff `1`.  The reindexing `1 + 1 + k =
k + 2` is the one non-definitional step below.  Mutating `Icc` to `Ico`, the
successor's `+ 1` to `+ 2`, or the divisor `m` to `m + 1` breaks the
restatement. -/

/-! ## Erdős 257 measure, over the vocabulary upstream would own

Two candidates were prepared here: `volume mersenneAchievementSet = 1`, and
the support-restricted classification.  Only the second is offered.

The first is the second's `F = ∅` case.  Taking `J = Set.univ` in the
dichotomy below gives `F = ∅` and `volume = ((2 : ℝ≥0∞) ^ 0)⁻¹ = 1`, and this
corpus proves `supportedMersenneAchievementSet Set.univ = mersenneAchievementSet`
(`ErdosProblems/Erdos257/MersenneSubseriesRigidity.lean`).  Offering both would
present one classification as two advances and would cost three further
definitions upstream for a strictly weaker statement.

`J` is the set of **allowed** coordinates; the omitted ones are `Jᶜ`.
Coordinate `k` carries exponent `k + 1`, so exponent `0` — whose Mersenne
weight is `1 / (2⁰ - 1)`, zero under Lean's division convention — never
enters.  Deleting finitely many coordinates costs one binary branch each,
giving `2⁻|F|`; deleting infinitely many drives the measure to `0`.

Six definitions are needed to state it, and none of the certificate-kernel,
sunflower, or half-counterexample machinery appears in its import closure.
Mutating `mersenneWeight (k + 1)` to `mersenneWeight k`, or `F.card` to
`F.card + 1`, breaks the restatement. -/

/-! ### Geometry of the same restricted sets

The measure above says how big these sets are; this says what shape they are,
over the same six definitions and with no further upstream cost.

Five predicates, and no sixth.  `IsClosed` is not a conjunct: the set is a
compact subset of `ℝ`, and `Perfect` carries closedness in its own first
component, so stating it would be padding rather than content.  `Perfect` is
the one predicate that needs `J.Infinite` -- a finite `J` admits finitely many
digit strings, so the set is finite and every point of it is isolated.

Total disconnectedness is stated for arbitrary `J` rather than only for the
full set.  `IsTotallyDisconnected s` unfolds to a condition quantified over
subsets of `s`, so it descends along `⊆` with no work, exactly as nowhere
density already does.  That is what makes a separate full-set geometry offer
redundant instead of merely overlapping: at `J = Set.univ` this theorem is the
full-set statement, since `supportedMersenneAchievementSet Set.univ =
mersenneAchievementSet`, and unique coding is the injectivity conjunct.  One
theorem, not two. -/

/-! ### Settled infinite-support families

`erdos_257` asks whether *every* infinite support gives an irrational sum.
These four say yes for four named families, in the shape the open statement
itself uses -- `∑' n : A, 1 / (b ^ n - 1)` over a subtype -- so they need no
upstream vocabulary at all.  `tsum_subtype` is the whole bridge from this
corpus's indicator-indexed `erdosSupportSeries`.

The two explicitly-indexed families are stated over `k` rather than over
`Set.range`, matching the checked source exactly; reindexing them through the
range set would add an injectivity obligation and buy nothing.

None of this is new mathematics.  Eventually periodic supports are the `0`-`1`
coefficient case of Luca-Tachiya; pairwise-coprime supports are Erdős (1968);
the factorial and powers-of-two families sit in the Erdős-Straus rapid-growth
framework, and Duverney later proved the powers-of-two value transcendental. -/
