# Plectis: research on eight Erdős problem programmes

Plectis is an open-source, AI-assisted prototype for turning mathematical
exposition into further research. Eight Erdős programmes each have a short
expository paper, a longer research record and associated Lean source. The aim
is to make results, methods and useful failures understandable enough for
others to question, extend and reuse.
**The degree-seven counterexample found by the erdosproblems.com contributor
ani refutes the total-variation formulation of Erdős #1041; this repository formalises it in
Lean. The other seven target problems are not resolved here. Independent
human review of correspondence with the historical curve-length formulation
has not been recorded. Comparator checks only its selected exact statements,
configured axioms and kernel acceptance; it does not assess novelty or
historical correspondence.**

The attribution is recorded in [ani's 7 September 2026 forum post](https://www.erdosproblems.com/forum/thread/1041#post-8861).

This release does not solve Erdős #68, #243, #249, #251, #257, #269, or #1049.
Those seven remain open.

![Eight Erdős problem programmes: papers, checked results, failed routes, and questions another researcher can continue](.github/system-map.png)

## Where to start

**Read the mathematics. Find what comes next.** Use the papers, proofs and
research records to continue an existing question, or to develop a new result,
method or direction. Work with your own AI, directly in the repository, or
without an AI. Work that returns becomes part of the shared account, with its
sources, checks and credit kept visible.

- **Explore with your AI, no clone needed.** Give your model the
  [reading edition](docs/reading-edition/README.md): one file with an
  introduction, a short research instruction and the opening of each paper.
  [One open investigation](research/experiments/choices_contraction/README.md)
  shows the route and ends with five ways to continue it.
- **Work in the repository.** The
  [agent quickstart](docs/agents/README.md#start-with-current-public-work)
  provides clone commands and a copyable prompt. Name a question, or ask your
  agent to read the corpus and decide what is worth developing.

The short papers are the main exposition: the question, the strongest results,
the ideas behind their proofs and what remains open. The longer records keep
the details, computations and approaches that stopped. You can read both
without Lean or a coding agent. The website brings these papers, their evidence
and ways to contribute into one reading experience. [A reader's way in](docs/READING_GUIDE.md)
introduces the questions; [Results and limits](docs/RESULTS.md) puts the results
beside their remaining open questions.

Read a [problem paper](#problem-papers), then use the [source map](docs/SOURCE_MAP.md)
to follow a statement into Lean, the proof assistant that checks its formal
proof. You can also use the record to compare methods, find a connection,
explain an obstruction, repair a formalisation gap, or propose a correction.
[CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) explains how to return that work with credit.

### Bring your own agent

The [agent quickstart](docs/agents/README.md#start-with-current-public-work)
provides clone commands, a copyable prompt and small first tasks. Start new work
from current public `main`; keep the starting commit when returning a result.
Navigation needs Git and Python 3. Proof builds have separate setup. No model
account or private system is required to [follow one claim](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md#try-one-claim-without-lean).

## Why this exists

I prioritised expository quality and a collaborative structure over trying to
solve the problems; I hope to now solve them with others rather than alone.
The idea is to turn intermediary findings into something reusable by
mathematicians who actually understand the material. That includes the routes
that stopped and the reasons they stopped.

I am responsible for all claims, sources and the release. Plectis is an
independent, AI-assisted prototype, not something I am declaring finished.
It has had no independent mathematical review (trying to get this), and I
need help to get anywhere near "done". Meaning, novelty and significance still
need human judgement.

## Problem papers

For a first look, start with **#249** for bases and exact ranks of totient
kernels: the sequences obtained by restricting Euler's totient to arithmetic
progressions. Or start with **#257** for weighted conditions on the exponents
that force reciprocal Mersenne subseries to be irrational, and for
achievement-set measure. Each paper distinguishes ordinary proofs,
Lean-checked results and open questions; the results guide covers all eight
programmes.

**Reading the eight together.** The whole collection is also material for new
mathematics: reusable constructions, connections between problems and questions
that go beyond the original targets. Start with the
[cross-problem paper, Reading Eight Erdős Problems Together](paper/synthesis/optimal-sparse-perturbations.pdf). It joins the capacity and congruence results, Lambert subsums, method limits and their research record.
The [synthesis guide](paper/synthesis/README.md) explains how to develop this work
from the papers and Lean corpus, with each result's evidence and limits intact.

## What Lean and Comparator verify

Lean verifies that a compiled proof establishes the formal statement written
in the source. Use the [source map](docs/SOURCE_MAP.md) to locate a declaration
cited in a paper. The [claim records](docs/claims.json) list the published
statements and their status; [prior art](docs/PRIOR_ART.md) lists earlier
results and their relationship to the work here.

Comparator compares a separately declared statement with the statement
established by its Lean solution, using an explicit list of allowed assumptions.
[`formalization.yaml`](formalization.yaml) lists the **selected statements**;
the comparison does not cover every theorem in this repository. The
[verification dossier](docs/EXTERNAL_VERIFICATION.md) identifies the selected
statements across all eight problems and the limits of the comparison.

Researchers still have to judge whether a formal statement expresses the
intended problem, whether it is new, and whether it is worth studying.
[Methodology](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) records the evidence and review required
before changing a public claim. Do not infer results from private or
unreleased work.

## Contribute

An idea, a correction, a counterexample, a failed route with a checkable
reason, or a clearer explanation can help. You do not need to solve a problem.
Directions and infrastructure suggestions receive credit too.

You can contribute an insight without writing Lean. Will can work with you to
develop its argument and formalisation; the idea, explanation and proof work
keep their respective attribution. A contribution may advance one problem or
open a direction across the whole collection.

Start with [a paper](docs/CONTRIBUTE_BY_PAPER.md),
[develop a method](paper/synthesis/README.md), or
[improve the machinery](docs/research-commons/ARCHITECTURE_CONTRIBUTIONS.md).
The same [submission and credit process](CONTRIBUTING.md#return-what-you-learned)
serves all three, including contributions by email and work without a clone.

- **Ideas, corrections or review:** use the
  [research-progress form](https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos/issues/new?template=research_progress.yml)
  or [email me](https://wcook04.github.io/plectis/#contact).
- **Changes to the repository:** follow [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Your own agent and spare compute:** use the [frontier relay](docs/FRONTIER_RELAY.md)
  to choose a starting point and return what you find with its evidence.

When maintainers accept contributed work, they commit a receipt naming the
contributor and the files, results or evidence being credited. The
[credit policy](docs/research-commons/CREDIT_POLICY.md) explains how contributions
are attributed. Browse [source attributions](docs/research-commons/SOURCE_ATTRIBUTIONS.md)
for named prior work and anonymous credit for implemented private advice.

If you solve a problem, the credit and the result are all yours. If this repo
or my intermediary progress helped, please cite this release and say how, so
others find it and we make progress together instead of hoarding partial
results out of fear of being scooped, or rebuilding the same infrastructure
instead of improving one cumulatively.

**Experts:** corrections, methods and directions are welcome. Accepted work
gets a public receipt naming the contribution and its author; later work
records how it used that contribution. See the
[credit policy](docs/research-commons/CREDIT_POLICY.md).

## Read or verify locally

[REPRODUCIBILITY](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) owns clone, claim-inspection and proof
build instructions. The clone is hundreds of megabytes; building proofs also
downloads Lean and Mathlib. Cloning runs no project code; the
[security policy](.github/SECURITY.md) explains the execution boundary.

Use the [documentation index](docs/README.md) for the file map and specialist
guides. [How the repository works](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explains the roles of
proofs, papers and checks. Coding agents start at [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and
follow the [agent workbench](docs/agents/AGENT_WORKBENCH.md); the
[agent-navigation paper](paper/systems/cold-clone-to-proof-receipt.pdf)
explains that design.

## Corpus at a glance

The reviewed layer a mathematician should judge: 148 curated claim records in 33 contribution families, reaching Lean source through 463 principal declaration links. `docs/SCOPE.md` gives its shape and `docs/RESULTS.md` gives the strongest checked result per problem. The website and the papers are the human reading path.

The rest is engineering inventory. About 88% of the 162,543 declarations (142,668 across 695 modules) are machine-emitted certificate shards: one integer checked prime, one position excluded. The remainder is not all hand-written either.

| Engineering inventory | Current size |
|---|---:|
| Lean modules (the two library roots) | 1,770 |
| Formal results and supporting lemmas | 158,837 |
| Curated claim records | 148 |
| Contribution families | 33 |

Generated shards are counted as formal source and never as separate
mathematical claims. Claim records cover every status, including cited and
open, and are partitioned once.
These are navigation counts, not novelty claims. They still need expert validation.

## Following a result into Lean

The paper links each headline result to the relevant source. For a particular
topic, start with the [source map](docs/SOURCE_MAP.md); it gives the module
order without asking you to decode Lean declaration names first.
