# Full paper assemblies for reduced tails and gcd stabilisation

The stable gcd is carried explicitly: the positivity, reducedness, and both
exact quotient recurrences are concluded.
No extra positivity assumption is imposed in the cofinal-negative version;
it is derived from the supplied signed-error hypotheses.

/-- Both papers, `res:gcdstab`: complete signed cofinal-negative statement.
The tuple includes the stable gcd and the positive reduced exact tail.
Only natural denominator nonnegativity, not strict denominator positivity,
is required by the definition of a reduced tail in the short note. -/
