# Analytic part of the canonical tail bridge

Uncompiled candidates.  The principal analytic assertion is proved, not
postulated: if positive summable terms have successive ratio tending to
zero, their tail divided by the leading term tends to one.

The final theorem derives normalised vanishing from quadratic growth and
an exact tail representation.  It does NOT claim to have constructed the
canonical integer state, proved its integrality, or obtained the sharper
O(1/a_n) expansion required elsewhere in the papers.
