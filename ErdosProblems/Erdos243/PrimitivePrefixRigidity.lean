# Erdős #243: primitive prefix rigidity

Suppose a reduced tail has no cancellation on a block and satisfies
`u (n + 1) + v n = a n * u n` and `v (n + 1) = a n * v n` there.  The first
two theorems give the exact finite-block transfer and approximation formula;
the last two isolate the divisibility forced by a complete prefix product.

The approximation numerator is the terminal primitive numerator itself, so
ordinary rational separation yields only its positivity.  No theorem here
proves that an actual #243 orbit has arbitrarily long cancellation-free
blocks, produces a large prefix gcd, or derives a contradiction.
