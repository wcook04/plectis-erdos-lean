# Finite repair deadlines and return transport

The September 2026 return batch proves a converse to the cofinal repair
consumer in ordinary mathematics. Combining that converse with the existing
support-uniform square-root tail bound gives more: every surviving orbit
repairs within a square-root sized window. This is an exact equivalence at
4/9, not a proof that the repair producer holds.

The analytic returns also use close returns outside reciprocal summability.
Their radix transport must therefore accept close returns directly, without
silently retaining the older reciprocal-summability hypothesis.
