# A repair criterion for every nonnegative real target

The four-ninths argument does not require a rational or periodic target.
For the actual greedy support of `x`, subtract its Lambert prefix integer
from `floor (2^N x)`. Membership is equivalent to cofinal nonincreases of
this natural defect, and also to a repair in every explicit square-root
window. Nonmembership forces geometric growth through the actual fatal gap.
