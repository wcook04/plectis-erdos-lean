# Depth = period: the period-multiple kill supply

Erdős #249 asks whether `S = ∑ φ(n)/2^n` is irrational.  The certificate
engine (`certifiedKill`) and its soundness/completeness are landed; this file
adds the **ray-restricted normal form** that the cyclotomic-fan analysis
converges to, plus the first denominator deposits beyond the 64-smooth
diagonal bank.

## The depth = period cut

For the two-block integer `W(h,N) = Q_{h,N+h} - Q_{h,N}` (which is exactly
`windowDiscrepancy h N h`), the block law at heights `h` gives the real
identity `W = 2^h·δ_h(N) - δ_h(N+h)` with `δ_h(M) = R_{M+h} - R_M`.  If `S`
is rational with denominator `2^c·v` (`v` odd) then for every multiple `h`
of a period of `v` and every `N ≥ c` both `δ`'s are integers, so
`W ≡ -δ_h(N+h) (mod 2^h)` with `|δ_h(N+h)| < N+2h+2`: the residue is pinned
to the two edge arcs.  A central residue — `certifiedKill h N h` — refutes
that denominator class outright.  The unknown odd part `v` enters only
through the arithmetic progression of admissible `h`, never the modulus.

## The supply normal form

`PeriodMultipleKillSupply` demands, for every ray `d` and every basepoint
threshold `c`, one certified kill at some period `t·d` and some `N ≥ c`
(any depth `L`).  This is **exactly equivalent** to irrationality:
sufficiency composes the Euler tail-period law with a telescoping step, and
necessity is certificate completeness.  `ApFullDepthEscape` is the
depth-locked (`L = h`) variant, the cleanest single open statement this
programme has produced.  `FullDepthRayAmplifier.apFullDepthEscape_iff_irrational`
proves `ApFullDepthEscape` necessary and sufficient for irrationality.

## Nesting (the fan collapses onto the dyadic tower)

`totientBlock_add` is the concatenation identity
`Q_{a+b,N} = 2^b·Q_{a,N} + Q_{b,N+a}`.  It makes the order-4 cyclotomic
channel at height `h` literally the order-2 channel at height `2h`
(`Ψ₄(2^h) = 2^{2h}+1 = Ψ₂(2^{2h})`), so the 2–3–4 fan is a nested family of
depth = period tests along the tower `h, 2h, 4h, …`, not three unrelated
moduli.

## New deposits

The diagonal bank certifies kills at `periodLcm t = lcm(1..t)` through
`t = 64` (`certifiedKill_diagonal_t64`), covering every odd `v` whose
multiplicative order of 2 divides `lcm(1..64)`.  The first prime-power
periods it cannot reach are `67, 81, 97, 101, 121, 125, 127, 128`.  This
file certifies kills at all eight (basepoint `N = 300`), each yielding the
denominator exclusion `S ≠ r` for `r.den ∣ 2^300·(2^h - 1)` — new odd
classes including the Cole factors `2^67 - 1 = 193707721 · 761838257287`
and the Mersenne prime `2^127 - 1`.
