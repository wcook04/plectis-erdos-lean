# Erdős #1041: the Abel control polygon and the all-degree monic trinomial family

**Claim boundary.**  Erdős #1041 (Erdős–Herzog–Piranian) asks whether, for every
monic polynomial whose zeros lie in the open unit disc, some two zeros can be
joined by a curve of length `< 2` inside `{|f| < 1}`.  **That problem remains
open, and nothing in this file proves it.**  What is proved here is a *solved
family* — the complete Schur-stable monic trinomial face `z^n + a z^m + b`, in
every degree and for every intermediate exponent — together with the general
Abel machinery that produces it and an explicit sextic showing where the radial
mechanism stops.

The file has four parts.

* **§1 The Abel control polygon.**  For a coefficient function `c : ℕ → ℂ` with
  degree bound `n` and a zero `ζ`, the evaluated coefficient truncations
  `S j = ∑_{k ≤ j} c k ζ^k` are control points of a Bézier-type representation
  of the whole radial segment:
  `∑_{j < n} (t^j - t^(j+1)) S j = p (t ζ)`.
  The weights are nonnegative on `[0,1]` and sum to `1 - t^n`.
* **§2 The finite radial containment certificate.**  If every control point has
  norm at most `R`, then `‖p (t ζ)‖ ≤ R (1 - t^n)` for `0 ≤ t ≤ 1`.  A continuum
  maximum over a segment has been replaced by finitely many algebraic numbers.
* **§3 The all-degree monic trinomial theorem.**  For `f z = z^n + a z^m + b`
  with `1 ≤ m < n` and every zero in the open unit disc, every radial segment
  from `0` to a zero lies in `{|f| < 1}`; two distinct zeros are therefore joined
  through the origin by a broken line of length `‖ζ₁‖ + ‖ζ₂‖ < 2`.  The
  hypothesis `‖b‖ < 1` is **derived**, not assumed: `norm_const_lt_one_of_roots_lt_one`
  obtains it from Vieta's product formula applied to `X^n + C a * X^m + C b`.
  The coefficient `a` is completely unrestricted.
* **§4 Pivot cancellation for a general polynomial.**  Eliminating one chosen
  coefficient `a m` at a zero leaves an identity in which that coefficient does
  not appear, and a scalar condition `N_m(t) ≤ t^n + δ (1 - t^m)` on the
  remaining modes (with `δ = 1 - ‖a 0‖`) certifies the whole radial segment.
  This is the anisotropic neighbourhood of the trinomial face.
* **§5 The sextic guardrail.**  For `f_r z = z^6 + (1/5) r^2 z^4 - (1/5) r^4 z^2 - r^6`
  every zero has modulus exactly `r`, yet `f_r (r/2) = -(327/320) r^6`, so the
  radial spoke to the zero `r` leaves `{|f| < 1}` as soon as `r^6 > 320/327`.
  Two active intermediate modes suffice to break the radial mechanism, which is
  exactly why §3 stops at trinomials.  The sextic is *not* a counterexample to
  Erdős #1041: a different pair of its zeros still admits a short path.  Only
  the prescribed radial spoke fails, and only that is claimed here.

Relation to the rest of the corpus.  `CyclicTrinomialFiberCase.lean` already
kernel-checks the three-term cancellation identity and its norm estimate in the
quotient variable, with `‖c‖ < 1` taken as a hypothesis;
`CyclicTetranomialCoefficientCase.lean` does the four-term case;
`TrinomialInterpolationSpoke.lean` records the endpoint-vanishing remainder.
What is new here is the identity at **arbitrary** degree with the partial-sum
control points, the `R (1 - t^n)` certificate, the derivation of `‖b‖ < 1` from
the root hypothesis, the packaged trinomial conclusion, the pivot sufficient
condition, and the sextic guardrail (previously only stated, in
`BarycentricEnvelope.md` §5).

/-- **Pivot cancellation.**  For a monic polynomial with constant term `a0`,
leading term `z^n` and intermediate modes indexed by `insert m s`, eliminating
the pivot coefficient `aCoeff m` at a zero `ζ` gives an identity in which the
pivot coefficient does not occur:

`f (t ζ) = a0 (1 - t^m) + ζ^n (t^n - t^m) + ∑_{k ∈ s} a_k ζ^k (t^k - t^m)`.

Every remaining mode carries the factor `t^k - t^m`, which vanishes at `t = 0`
and (for the `k` in play) is controlled on `[0,1]`.  In the intended
application `m ∉ s` and `s ⊆ Ico 1 n`, but the identity needs neither. -/

/-- **The sextic guardrail.**  For `320/327 < r^6` and `0 < r < 1`, every zero of
`f_r` lies in the open unit disc, yet the radial spoke from the origin to the
zero `r` leaves `{|f_r| < 1}` at the parameter `1/2`.

Two active intermediate modes are enough to destroy the radial mechanism that
solves the trinomial face in §3 — the Abel control polygon of the spoke to `r`
is `-r^6, -r^6, -(6/5) r^6, -(6/5) r^6, -r^6, -r^6`, which leaves the unit disc
and returns, a pattern impossible with a single intermediate coefficient.

This is **not** a counterexample to Erdős #1041: only the prescribed radial
spoke fails, and a different pair of zeros of `f_r` still admits a short path.
The statement below claims exactly the spoke failure and nothing more. -/
