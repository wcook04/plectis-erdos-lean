# Restartable streaming prime certificate

Unlike primeSumLoop, the integer prefix is accumulated by Horner's rule:
A <- 2*A+p when a prime is encountered.  Fixed-size blocks can be compiled
separately and their endpoint equalities chained.  Generated endpoint
literals are not trusted: each block must succeed with `decide +kernel`.
Neither native_decide nor an external primality oracle is used.  Primality
is decided by `Fast.isPrimeG` (`GcdPrimality`), which equals the
trial-division test `isPrimeTD` and costs one gcd per scanned integer.
