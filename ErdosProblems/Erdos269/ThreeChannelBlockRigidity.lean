# Erdős #269: signed three-channel block rigidity

If every block between two occurrences of the same channel has signed sum
zero, then the signed word is a coboundary of a potential on the channel
space.  For three channels, zero perturbation at transitions `2 → 3` and
`2 → 5` makes that potential constant and therefore makes the entire signed
word zero.

No declaration here asserts irrationality of the `{2,3,5}` running-LCM
series.  In particular, the file neither constructs the ordered-power jump
word nor proves that its induced perturbation is block-null.  Those are
separate problem-specific inputs.
