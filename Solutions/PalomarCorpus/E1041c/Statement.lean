# Statement environment for Palomar entry E1041c

Every non-theorem declaration of `PalomarCorpus/E1041c/Challenge.lean`, verbatim and in
the same order, elaborated against Mathlib alone. The Solution modules import this file
instead of re-declaring or aliasing the definitions, so every constant that Comparator
walks from a compared theorem statement is byte-identical in the Challenge and Solution
environments. Generated from the Challenge; do not edit by hand.

/-- **Geodesic polar coordinates on the hyperbolic plane.** `polar d θ` is the point of the upper half-plane at hyperbolic distance `|d|` from the centre `i` with argument `θ`: the image of the Poincaré-disc point `tanh (d/2) e^{iθ}` (the paper's coordinates) under the Cayley transform `w ↦ i(1+w)/(1-w)`, which is `(-(sinh d sin θ) + i)/(cosh d - sinh d cos θ)`.
