# Statement environment for Palomar entry E257w

Every non-theorem declaration of `PalomarCorpus/E257w/Challenge.lean`, verbatim and in
the same order, elaborated against Mathlib alone. The Solution modules import this file
instead of re-declaring or aliasing the definitions, so every constant that Comparator
walks from a compared theorem statement is byte-identical in the Challenge and Solution
environments. Generated from the Challenge; do not edit by hand.

/-- Structural part of an endpoint-by-endpoint repair trajectory. The arithmetic producer receipts are separated into `GlobalBooleanMobiusRepairFeasible` below. Local copy of Erdos249257.BooleanMobiusGlobalRepairTrajectory, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/
