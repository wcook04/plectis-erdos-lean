# Statement environment for Palomar entry E257al

Every non-theorem declaration of `PalomarCorpus/E257al/Challenge.lean`, verbatim and in
the same order, elaborated against Mathlib alone. The Solution modules import this file
instead of re-declaring or aliasing the definitions, so every constant that Comparator
walks from a compared theorem statement is byte-identical in the Challenge and Solution
environments. Generated from the Challenge; do not edit by hand.

/-- **The support coefficient** `f_A(n) = #{d ∣ n : d ∈ A}` — the Dirichlet incidence `1_A * 1` of a support set `A ⊆ ℕ`. This is the coefficient in which Erdős #257 is actually stated: `∑_{a∈A} 1/(b^a - 1) = ∑_n f_A(n)/b^n`. Full support gives `f_ℕ = τ`; primes give `ω`; prime powers give `Ω`.

The `a = 0` term is `1/(1-1) = 0` under real division-by-zero conventions, so supports containing `0` contribute nothing spurious.
