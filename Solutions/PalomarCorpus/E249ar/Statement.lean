# Statement environment for Palomar entry E249ar

Every non-theorem declaration of `PalomarCorpus/E249ar/Challenge.lean`, verbatim and in
the same order, elaborated against Mathlib alone. The Solution modules import this file
instead of re-declaring or aliasing the definitions, so every constant that Comparator
walks from a compared theorem statement is byte-identical in the Challenge and Solution
environments. Generated from the Challenge; do not edit by hand.

/-- The scalar contributed by the odd prime factors of `r`. Local copy of Erdos249257.CyclicTensorMobiusShadow.oddJordanScalar, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/
noncomputable def oddJordanScalar (r : ℕ) : ℤ :=
  ∏ q ∈ r.primeFactors.filter (fun q => q ≠ 2), ((q : ℤ) ^ 2 - 1)
/-- `Hₜ = lcm(1, ..., t)`. The interval avoids inserting zero into the finite LCM. Local copy of Erdos249257.MersenneShadowCyclotomicNoncollapse.lcmHeight, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/
noncomputable def lcmHeight (t : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  (Finset.Icc 1 t).lcm (fun n ↦ n)
/-- The squarefree kernel used by the numeric shadow: the product of the distinct prime factors of `n`. For `n = 0` this convention gives `1`; all development-facing scaling theorems assume `0 < n`. Local copy of Erdos249257.RadicalMobiusShadow.squarefreeKernel, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/
noncomputable def squarefreeKernel (n : ℕ) : ℕ := ∏ p ∈ n.primeFactors, p
/-- `rₜ = rad(Hₜ)` using the canonical T6 squarefree kernel. Local copy of Erdos249257.MersenneShadowCyclotomicNoncollapse.lcmRadical, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/
noncomputable def lcmRadical (t : ℕ) : ℕ :=
  squarefreeKernel (lcmHeight t)
/-- `hₜ = Hₜ / rₜ`, the scale multiplying the radical shadow. Local copy of Erdos249257.MersenneShadowCyclotomicNoncollapse.lcmScale, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/

/-- The Mersenne denominator at exponent `n`. Local copy of Erdos249257.RadicalMobiusShadow.mersenne, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/
noncomputable def mersenne (n : ℕ) : ℕ := 2 ^ n - 1
/-- The integral numerator, written as its squarefree-divisor expansion. For `s ⊆ primeFactors(r)`, put `d = ∏ p ∈ s, p`. Then the summand is `(-1)^|s| (r/d) ((2^r-1)/(2^d-1))`. This is exactly the nonzero part of `Σ_{d ∣ r} μ(d) (r/d) ((2^r-1)/(2^d-1))`: nonsquarefree divisors have Möbius coefficient zero. The subset form makes that finite support explicit and keeps the definition executable without factoring irrelevant divisors. Local copy of Erdos249257.RadicalMobiusShadow.mobiusNumerator, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/

/-- The unscaled radical shadow `B(r) = M_r / (2^r - 1)`. Local copy of Erdos249257.RadicalMobiusShadow.baseMobiusShadow, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/
noncomputable def baseMobiusShadow (r : ℕ) : ℚ :=
  Rat.divInt (mobiusNumerator r) (mersenne r : ℤ)
/-- The numeric shadow at an arbitrary scale. By construction it only sees the distinct prime factors of `H`. Local copy of Erdos249257.RadicalMobiusShadow.numericMobiusShadow, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/
