# Statement environment for Palomar entry E257_07

Every non-theorem declaration of `PalomarCorpus/E257_07/Challenge.lean`, verbatim and in
the same order, together with the proof obligations those declarations name, each stated
verbatim from the Challenge and proved in place from the source development that this file
imports for those proofs. The Solution modules import this file instead of re-declaring or
aliasing the definitions, so every constant that Comparator walks from a compared theorem
statement is elaborated from the same text in the same module as in the Challenge.
Generated from the Challenge; do not edit by hand.
