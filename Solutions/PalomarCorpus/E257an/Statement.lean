# Statement environment for Palomar entry E257an

Every non-theorem declaration of `PalomarCorpus/E257an/Challenge.lean`, verbatim and in
the same order, elaborated against Mathlib alone. The Solution modules import this file
instead of re-declaring or aliasing the definitions, so every constant that Comparator
walks from a compared theorem statement is byte-identical in the Challenge and Solution
environments. Generated from the Challenge; do not edit by hand.

/-- Number of selected lower ranks which divide the next endpoint. Local copy of Erdos249257.endpointDivisorContribution, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/

/-- **The Erdős #257 support series** `∑_{a ∈ A} 1/(b^a - 1)`, as an indicator series over ℕ. The `a = 0` term is `1/(1-1) = 0` under real division-by-zero conventions, so supports containing `0` contribute nothing spurious.

/-- The finite Erdős partial sum `∑_{n ∈ F} 1 / (b ^ n - 1)` as a rational number, stated with subtraction in `ℚ` so the statement reads exactly like the mathematical series. Local copy of Erdos249257.finiteErdosSum, restated so the compared statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. -/

/-- **The support coefficient** `f_A(n) = #{d ∣ n : d ∈ A}` — the Dirichlet incidence `1_A * 1` of a support set `A ⊆ ℕ`. This is the coefficient in which Erdős #257 is actually stated: `∑_{a∈A} 1/(b^a - 1) = ∑_n f_A(n)/b^n`. Full support gives `f_ℕ = τ`; primes give `ω`; prime powers give `Ω`.
