# Statement environment for Palomar entry E249g

Every non-theorem declaration of `PalomarCorpus/E249g/Challenge.lean`, verbatim and in
the same order, elaborated against Mathlib alone. The Solution modules import this file
instead of re-declaring or aliasing the definitions, so every constant that Comparator
walks from a compared theorem statement is byte-identical in the Challenge and Solution
environments. Generated from the Challenge; do not edit by hand.
