# Statement environment for Palomar entry E269_06

Every non-theorem declaration of `PalomarCorpus/E269_06/Challenge.lean`, verbatim and in
the same order, elaborated against Mathlib alone. The Solution modules import this file
instead of re-declaring or aliasing the definitions, so every constant that Comparator
walks from a compared theorem statement is byte-identical in the Challenge and Solution
environments. Generated from the Challenge; do not edit by hand.

/-- The predicate that the power `p ^ e` lies strictly inside the dyadic block from `2 ^ a` to `2 ^ (a + 1)`, that is `2 ^ a < p ^ e` and `p ^ e < 2 ^ (a + 1)`; for an odd prime `p` it records that a new pure `p`-power is crossed strictly between two consecutive powers of two, so that the running least common multiple gains one further factor `p` inside that block. -/
