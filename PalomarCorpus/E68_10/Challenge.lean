# Erdős #68, the strict successor carry family

Each theorem below restates, against Mathlib alone, a theorem of the Lean development
for Erdős problem #68, in the order the papers state them. The definitions a statement
uses are copied in, and each declaration's documentation names the paper statement and
the source declaration it comes from. Erdős problem #68 remains open, and no theorem in
this entry decides it.

/-- The Erdős 68 series `S = ∑_{d ≥ 2} 1/(d! - 1)`, restated in this namespace with the terms at `d ≤ 1` set to zero. -/

/-- The companion constant `C = ∑_{n ≥ 2} 1/(n! (n! - 1))`, a convergent real series whose terms are set to zero for `n ≤ 1` and which satisfies `C + (e - 2) = S` for the Erdős 68 series `S`. -/

Neither direction produces the cofinal miss. -/

/-- The complete strict successor characterisation in four conjuncts: eventual unit carries characterise failure of irrationality, cofinally many non unit carries characterise irrationality, at every `m ≥ 3` a unit carry is equivalent to `m` dividing `strictFacTopRat (H m) m`, and cofinal failure of that divisibility again characterises irrationality. The equivalences transfer the question to exact rational prefixes and supply no cofinal failure. -/
