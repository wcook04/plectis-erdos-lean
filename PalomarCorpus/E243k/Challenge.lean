# Palomar challenge for Erdős problem #243, band k

Erdős problem #243 is open and nothing here decides it. Each theorem below
restates one refereed declaration of the paper-linked Lean development for this
problem, with the definitions its statement mentions copied in so the whole file
elaborates against Mathlib alone. The declaration documentation names the source
declaration each statement is transported from. This band is a packaging split of
`PalomarCorpus/E243` under the Challenge size ceiling; it does not replace it.
