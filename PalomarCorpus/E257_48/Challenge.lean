# Erdős #257, note section 9: further questions

Each theorem below restates, against Mathlib alone, a theorem of the Lean development
for Erdős problem #257, in the order the papers state them. The definitions a statement
uses are copied in, and each declaration's documentation names the paper statement and
the source declaration it comes from. Erdős problem #257 remains open, and no theorem in
this entry decides it.
