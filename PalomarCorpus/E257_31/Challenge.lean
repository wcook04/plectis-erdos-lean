# Erdős #257, record sections 6 to 10: detailed results and their hypotheses; hypothesis-specific obstructions (part 2 of 2)

Each theorem below restates, against Mathlib alone, a theorem of the Lean development
for Erdős problem #257, in the order the papers state them. The definitions a statement
uses are copied in, and each declaration's documentation names the paper statement and
the source declaration it comes from. Some theorems below are lemmas or proof fields
that the copied definitions name, and their documentation says so; the papers state none
of them, and the Solution proves each from the source. Erdős problem #257 remains open,
and no theorem in this entry decides it.
