# Erdős #251, note sections 1 to 4: introduction; the prime series and its actual tails; integral shifts: an exact algebraic classification

Each theorem below restates, against Mathlib alone, a theorem of the Lean development
for Erdős problem #251, in the order the papers state them. The definitions a statement
uses are copied in, and each declaration's documentation names the paper statement and
the source declaration it comes from. Erdős problem #251 remains open, and no theorem in
this entry decides it.
