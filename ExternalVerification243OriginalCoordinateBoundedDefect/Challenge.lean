# Trusted challenge for the original-coordinate bounded product defect in Erdős #243

One source-independent proposition, stated in the original coordinates of the
problem.  Let `a` be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers whose
reciprocal series converges to a rational value `p / q`, and whose growth
satisfies `a (n+1) / a n ^ 2 → 1`.  Write `P n = ∏_{j < n} a j` and

  `productDefect a n = P n / a n * (a n ^ 2 / a (n+1) - 1)`.

If `productDefect a n` is bounded above from some index onward, then `a`
satisfies the Sylvester recurrence `a (n+1) = a n ^ 2 - a n + 1` eventually.

The rational value of the series is carried by an explicit integer numerator `p`
and positive natural denominator `q`. The finite-upper-limsup condition is
represented here by eventual boundedness above.

Boundary.  The hypothesis is a bounded product defect.  Erdős #243 asks for the
same conclusion with no such bound, and that remains open: nothing here supplies
the missing bound for an arbitrary sequence, and no part of this file settles
the parent problem.
