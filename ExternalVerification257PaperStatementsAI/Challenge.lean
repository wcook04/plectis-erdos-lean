# Independent restatements for Erdős problem #257

Each theorem below restates a refereed declaration of the substantive development in
this repository, at public commit `f436a7ec0f7bf035828a7eec37fd29ae74d17d84` of
https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos. The definitions are local copies of the source definitions, so
the statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. This module is a comparison interface
over that development, not the development itself. The mathematics is developed in
`ErdosProblems.Erdos257.PaperCompleteR21.TruncatedRungGreedyDecision`.
