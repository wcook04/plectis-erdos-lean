# Independent restatements for Erdős problem #257

Each theorem below restates a declaration of the substantive development in this repository,
at public commit `f436a7ec0f7bf035828a7eec37fd29ae74d17d84` of
https://github.com/wcook04/plectis-erdos: a refereed paper statement, or a lemma or a proof
field that a copied definition names, as its documentation says. The definitions are local
copies of the source definitions, so the statements elaborate against Mathlib alone. This
module is a comparison interface over that development, not the development itself. The
mathematics is developed in
`Erdos249257.HalfCylinderConcreteSeamAdapter`,
`Erdos249257.HalfCylinderFinalMiddleCellEscape`, `Erdos249257.HalfCylinderIntegerGreedy`.
