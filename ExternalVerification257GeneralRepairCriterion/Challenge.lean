# Trusted challenge for the general greedy repair criterion

A nonnegative real belongs to the base-two Mersenne achievement set exactly when its greedy
defect fails to increase at cofinally many scales, and exactly when it fails to increase at
one scale inside every window `[K, K + 2*sqrt K + 12)`. The criterion converts membership,
which quantifies over supports, into a pointwise inequality on a single integer sequence, and
it localises the search to a window of width `O(sqrt K)`. It decides no particular target, and
it does not settle Erdős #257.
