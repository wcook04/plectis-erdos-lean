# Trusted challenge for bounded-negative-part rigidity in Erdős #243

The theorem isolates the complete rigidity consequence of the bounded-negative
branch for exact reciprocal-tail dynamics.  An eventual one-sided lower bound
on the centered error together with division-free normalized vanishing force
both eventual zero defect and the exact Sylvester recurrence.  No periodicity
hypothesis is used.

The theorem is conditional on its explicit tail hypotheses.  It does not show
that every orbit in Erdős #243 satisfies them, and the unrestricted problem
remains open.
