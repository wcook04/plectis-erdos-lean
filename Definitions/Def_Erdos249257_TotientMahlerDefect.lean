# Exact ranks of dyadic totient kernels

For `K_{j,r}(n) = φ(2^j n + r)`, this module proves two unconditional rank
statements relevant to Erdős #249:

* the complete kernel through every positive level `e` has dimension
  exactly `2^e+1` over `ℚ`;
* the kernel containing all dyadic levels is infinite-dimensional.

The proof first removes the repeated even-residue channels.  It then proves
linear independence of the remaining canonical family by constructing a
nonzero evaluation minor: CRT and Dirichlet's theorem make one affine channel
prime while forcing a fresh prime divisor in every other channel.  The exact
rank of the complete truncation follows because the removed channels reduce
recursively to lower-level canonical channels.

These are structural theorems about Euler's totient sequence, not a proof that
the totient series is irrational.  A rationality argument would still have to
produce a finite-rank compression, or an equivalent contradiction object,
from the assumed rationality of that series.

/-! ## An explicit basis for the span of every dyadic section

The finite-level theorems above already determine the whole linear-relation
structure of the dyadic sections of `φ`, because linear independence has finite
character.  Assembling them gives one *infinite* linearly independent family --
the two zero-residue channels `n ↦ φ(n)`, `n ↦ φ(2n)` together with one channel
`n ↦ φ(2^(j+1) n + 2r+1)` for every odd residue at every level -- which by
`totientKernel_zero_residue` and `totientKernel_even_residue_reduce` spans every
remaining dyadic section.  It is therefore a basis of the span of the full
dyadic kernel, which is strictly sharper than the infinite-dimensionality
statement above: it says that the only `ℚ`-linear relations among dyadic
sections of `φ` are the ones generated by those two elementary identities.

This is a theorem about `φ`, not about `∑ φ(n)/2ⁿ`.  It proves no irrationality
statement and leaves the rationality-side finite-rank compression theorem
untouched. -/
