# Primitive `2p + 3q` multiplicity at multiples of ten

The Stern--Brocot expansion of the cylinder

`1 / ((2^2 - 1) * (2^3 - 1)) = 1 / 21`

emits one reciprocal-Mersenne term at rank `2p + 3q` for every positive
coprime pair `(p,q)`.  Rank ten is the first place where Booleanisation loses
one unit.  The lemmas below isolate the exact primitive-cone arithmetic.  They
do not prove that the expansion Booleanises or that `1/21` belongs to the
Mersenne achievement set.
