# Cofinal exact rows from critical skipped-core capacity

This module packages the protected-core induction behind the sharp
skipped-core capacity route.  It proves that one explicit arithmetic supply
condition is sufficient for cofinally many exact Boolean--Möbius rows.  The
supply condition itself remains an assumption here; consequently the final
membership theorem in this file is a conditional reduction, not an
unconditional proof of Erdős problem 257.

/-- The remaining arithmetic socket in the protected-core construction.
Whenever a below-half core is crossed by rank `c`, adjoining `c` must already
reach the integral half target at endpoint `2c-2`.

By `localBinarySuffix_two_mul_sub_two_lt_criticalCapacity_iff`, this is exactly
the sharp `c-2`-bit capacity needed by the strict-upper skipped-core fill.
The deficit hypothesis records that `c` is a genuine crossing rank. -/

/-! ## The crossing core is the canonical half-greedy prefix -/

/-- A below-half core whose deficit is smaller than the next Mersenne weight
is forced to be the canonical half-greedy prefix through rank `c - 1`.

Indeed, after casting to `ℝ` the core is a half-straddling word at depth
`c - 1`: its value is below one half, while the full unresolved tail is at
least the crossing weight `w_c`.  Strict superincreasingness, packaged by
`IsStraddlePrefix.half_agrees_greedy`, fixes every bit of the word; the
primitive-prefix bridge then identifies those bits with the exact rational
greedy prefix. -/
